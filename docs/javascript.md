# JavaScript client
Perhaps the most common way to connect to a collection of REST/JSON services is via the browser, so this sample contains an HTML/JS sample.

The files are hosted by the [Node.js server](nodejs.md) from the public/ folder. There is simply a client.html and client.js file, but you will notice there are some libraries included via CDN:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery Cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie)
