- Added Apache Ivy to the project
  - ivy.xml is similar to package.json - defines dependencies
  - Ivy functionality is invoked by the Ant script.

- Added Apache Ant to the project
  - build.xml is the default Ant script
  - just run "ant" on the command line, and build.xml should be
    executed with the default "target" - war.
    Ant will then determine and execute the dependent targets.
  - Run 'ant ivy-resolve' to download the dependent jars to the lib/ dir per ivy.xml
    But, you don't have to do this, as I put the lib/ directory in the git repo.

- Reworked the directory structure
  - java source in src/
  - jsp files in jsp/
  - web config files in web/
  - added the lib/ directory - contains the set of files downloaded by Ivy
  - added the deploy/ directory - contains the generated war file

- Deployment
  - copy the deploy/multitenant.war to the Tomcat webapps/ directory.
    you may have to restart Tomcat, depending on its autodeploy setting.
  - optionally stop and restart Tomcat
  - Visit localhost:8080/multitenant/ with your browser
